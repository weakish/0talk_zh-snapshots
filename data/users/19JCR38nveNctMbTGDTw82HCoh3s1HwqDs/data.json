Did you know they call the Dalai Lama a terrorist ringleader? Funny news you might have missed. You see, China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. And those guys are pretty evil. They also have an iron grip on the world's second largest economy and the world's largest standing army. Whether it's threatening war with Japan, squashing citizen riots calling for democracy, or censoring news and the Internet, China's Communist Party is fighting to stay in power. They also put out a lot of fake news to trick people in China and in the West into thinking every thing is good. That's where NTD China Uncensored comes in.\n\nChina Uncensored is China news like the Daily Show or Colbert Report is US news. It's a little funny, a little scary, and pretty darn entertaining. Chris Chappell launches his war on the CCP with a sarcastic take on China's government abuse with the latest news.\n\nContact: chinauncensored[@]gmail.com",
